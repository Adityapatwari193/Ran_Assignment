# RAN Assignment (Telecom Simulation)

This project simulates a simplified **telecom RAN (Radio Access Network) and Core system** in Java.  
It is structured in 3 assignments:

1. **Assignment 1** â€“ Create basic `Node`, `RANNode`, `CoreNode`, and `InterfaceLink` classes.  
2. **Assignment 2** â€“ Group nodes into `RANSystem` and `CoreSystem` and print a small topology.  
3. **Assignment 3** â€“ Simulate a basic signaling flow (RAN â†’ Core registration) and log the messages.  
   - Includes optional *stretch goals*: validation rules, metrics tracking, and topology serialization.
